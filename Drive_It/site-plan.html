      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>[The expected audience for this product would be individuals that sometimes find themselves trapped in big cities and feel they can't escape because they don't have transportation or anywhere to store transportation. A subscription based company for something you really need. With so many subscription options you could market towards the wealthy and the less fotunate. Everyone could find this service useful.]</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <p></p>
      <h3>Condition of Vehicles</h3>
        <p>
          For now, there will be a 6-step process to check-out a vehicle and check-in a vehicle. It will all be done by the supervisor on duty. The guest may not be present at time of inspection. If the supervisor has questions for the guest, they will be retrieved after the inspection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Incoming<br><br>
1.	Everybody panel is looked over for extra scratches or dents. If a scratch or dent is found it must be notated with a picture in our software.<br>
2.	The car is started, gas level and mileage are noted with a picture. Any odd sounds or warning lights are noted. <br>
3.	The interior of the car is then looked through. Any wear and tear that is out of the ordinary is noted with a picture.<br>
4.	The trunk is then opened and looked through as well. Same applies as did to the interior.<br>
5.	The hood is popped and looked through. Any odd wear and tear is noted with a picture.<br>
6.	All notes are taken to the guest and looked over. If anything requires repair the guest will be notified within one business day.<br><br>
Outgoing<br><br>
1.	The car is started to double check that the gas is full and there are no warning lights. <br>
2.	The interior is looked through and checked to be clean. (Luxury cars will be detailed after every use but normal cars will not)<br>
3.	The car is then turned off and the oil level as well as other fluid levels are checked. Only when every fluid is checked can the car be let go with the guest. Any fluids that are low must be filled before leaving the premises. <br>
4.	The Guests driver's license is then checked and a picture of it is taken. (Every time)<br>
5.	At this point if the supervisor believes it's okay, the car may leave with the guest.<br>

      <h3>Subscription Options</h3>
          These are the base subscription options available for customers. Custom or different subscriptions will be offered based on company discretion. 
        </p>
        <p>
          1.	Base subscription: 7 rentals per month. No luxury or off-road allowed. Day rentals only. (Overnight will be allowed upon discretion and extra charge.)<br>
2.	Off-road subscription: Base subscription with allowance of off-road and overnight. Still 7 days per month. <br>
3.	Luxury: Base subscription with allowance to use luxury cars and off-road cars and overnight allowed.<br>
4.	Double: 14 days per month. No luxury or off-road. Day rentals only.<br>
5.	Commuter: Electric, smart, family sedans. Rentals paid for every time they're used. Significantly reduced subscription fee.<br>
6.	Work: Utility vehicles, SUVs, Pickup truck. Any weekday rental allowed with weekends allowed for special reasons. Companies receive reduced subscription fee.<br>
7.	Any others I think of in the future.<br><br>
All reservations are taken above any other request. Reservations may be made up to 90 days in advance. Cancelling within 30 days offers no penalty. Within 60 days is .2% of the car's blue book. Once there are 30 days, cancel price will be .4%. Within 20 days of reservation the guest will be charged 50% of the base subscription price or .8% of the car value (Lowest cost is charged. Within 10 days, the guest is charged the full base subscription fee. These caveats are in place to discourage unnecessary reservations or abuse of the reservation system. (Special circumstances may change this policy but it is all up to the franchise owner's discretion.) Absolutely no rental for over 7 consecutive days on any plan.
